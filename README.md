# PonyTown Scripts

Welcome to the PonyTown Scripts repository! This repository contains a collection of useful scripts for the game PonyTown, hosted via jsDelivr CDN for easy access.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Open PonyTown** in your browser.
2. **Type the following URL** into the browser’s address bar, replacing `<your selected script file .js>` with the desired script file name:

   ```plaintext
   javascript:fetch('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandSfk/pt@main/<your selected script file .js>').then(r => r.text()).then(eval);
   ```

### Example

1. **AFK Script**

   To use the AFK script, type the following into the browser’s address bar:

   ```plaintext
   javascript:fetch('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandSfk/pt@main/afk.js').then(r => r.text()).then(eval);
   ```

This will load and execute the script directly from the CDN within PonyTown. This method works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
