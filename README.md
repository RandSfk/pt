# PonyTown Scripts

Welcome to the PonyTown Scripts repository! This repository contains a collection of useful scripts for the game PonyTown, hosted via jsDelivr CDN for easy access.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts, you can include them in your HTML file or paste the link directly into your browser's console while playing PonyTown. Use the following template to select the desired script:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandSfk/pt@main/<your selected script file .js>
```

### Example

1. **AFK Script**

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandSfk/pt@main/afk.js
```

Replace `<your selected script file .js>` with the desired script file name from the list above. This will load the script directly from the CDN and allow you to use its functionality in PonyTown.

Feel free to add more script files to the list by following the same format.
